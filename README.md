- **Project Summary**: 
  Traffic modeling has always been difficult to preform. With the advent of new machine learning models, many new opprotunites arise to help engineers develop better ways to model traffic. What's the best machine learning application to predict traffic modeling, and how can traffic be predicted over time? The reasearch here focuses on trips taken by car at a National level in the United States from 2019-2021. The data comes from a United States government collection of driving behavior. The package Autogluon was used to predict future driving behavior beyond the scope of the data, and two seperate types of analysis were performed. One allowed for covariate variables, such as whether or not a given day was a holiday or the weekend. The other analysis did not allow for this control. This research will show that more advanced machine learning models are more helpful and accurate in predicting future traffic models. The results suggest that other fields relating to data forcasting may greatly benefit from addition of a machine learning model to help predict trends that legacy models may not pick up on.
